# Awesome Spatial Computing
## Papers
- [Making Smartphone Augmented Reality Apps Accessible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06035) — In this paper, we identify common constituent tasks in AR by analyzing existing mobile AR applications for iOS, and characterize the design space of tasks that require accessible alternatives. 
- [Hacking, Switching, Combining: Understanding and Supporting DIY Assistive Technology Design by Blind People](https://jayl.in/papers/CHI2023_DIY_AT.pdf) — We aim to understand this behavior in depth, and how BVI people envision creating future DIY personalized AT
- [Enable Blind Users’ Experience in 3D Virtual Environments: The Scene Weaver Prototype](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3544549.3583909) — Three-dimensional virtual environments are currently inaccessible to people who are blind, as current screen-reading solutions for 2D content are not fully extensible to achieve the needed embodied spatial presence.
## Apps
### Open Source
- [Soundscape](https://github.com/microsoft/soundscape) — For more than six years, Microsoft Research has been honored to develop the Soundscape research project, which was designed to deliver information about a person’s location and points of interest and has guided individuals to desired places and in unfamiliar spaces using augmented-reality and three-dimensional audio.
